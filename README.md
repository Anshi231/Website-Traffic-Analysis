In todayâ€™s digital landscape, user engagement is key to driving business success. One essential metric of this engagement is clickrate, which measures the percentage of users that take action by clicking on a link after viewing a page. The goal of this project is to analyze the traffic patterns from the provided dataset and develop actionable insights to optimize and increase the clickrates for various links.

This project will involve using advanced data analysis techniques to understand the volume and distribution of traffic events (e.g., clicks, pageviews) across different dimensions such as time, location, and link attributes. Additionally, we aim to identify factors influencing user behavior and derive strategies for improving engagement, ultimately driving better clickrates.
